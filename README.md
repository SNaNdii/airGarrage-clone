# About AirGarrage-clone

AirGarage manages parking properties, handling everything from payments to enforcement and more to increase revenue for owners. The parking industry has been the same for the last 50 years. Weâ€™re tackling it how it should be in the 21st century.
<br>
AirGarage is on a mission to rethink the 30% of downtown city real estate dedicated to parking.

I worked on this project during unit-2 construct week at Masai School.
